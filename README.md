# lostCauseIdeology

this project adapts text mining techniques to analyze dialogue extracted from the platform Twitter in order to evaluate the sentiments, emotions and positions towards Confederate monuments and flags that are so hotly debated, specifically within the context of pro and anti-Lost Cause ideology movements. The benefits of computerized text analysis come from the ability to evaluate and understand a previously extensive, complex and daunting collection of electronic sources of text. The estimation of positions on this topic, as well as the particular dialogue trends involved, offers potential benefit in understanding the development and reach of the Lost Cause ideology in modern social spaces. In this study, text analysis techniques are used on a collection of tweets involving topics related to the Lost Cause Ideology such as: monument removal, confederate cause, historical symbols, Unite the Right Rally and more.  The task was to extract Tweets through an API, determine the emotions of Twitter users towards the topic and define the most important and frequent words used in discussion and investigate trends with available location data.
